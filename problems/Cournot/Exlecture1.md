Often a utility function is defined 
by some parameters

Eloise’s preferences over tea (good 1) and biscuits (good 2) are represented by the “perfect
complements" utility function 

    $$u(x_1, x_2) = \min\left\{\frac{x_1}{\alpha}, \frac{x_2}{1 − \alpha}\right\}$$

    Show the effect of a decrease in α from $0.7$ to $0.3$.
