2. What is the wage that corresponds to this level of hiring?
3. Now, imagine that the government imposes a minimum wage much higher than this wage level, e.g. $19. Tick the relevant box next to the graph and explain what happens to the hiring levels and why. $\textit{Think about mch. Is the curve the same as before?}$
4. What if the government imposes a minimum wage higher (but not as high as before) than this wage level, e.g. $13? Tick the relevant box next to the graph and explain.
5. Will there be any effect on hiring levels if the minimum wage is lower than $9? Why?
