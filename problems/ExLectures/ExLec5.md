The following figure shows .. Consider Juliana facing the following utility function and risk-return schedule:
$$u(\hat{y},\Delta)=\hat{y}-\alpha\Delta^2$$
$$\hat{y}=-(\Delta-b)^2+c$$
      
1. Find $\Delta,\hat{y}(\Delta)$.
2. Assume $\alpha=0.5, b=5, c=10$ and calculate $\Delta, \hat{\Delta}$ for these parameter values. Use the graph using these values and verify what you found. 
3. Assume now that insurance is available with $p_s=2$. What is the slope of the insurance line? Use the slider on the graph to choose the value of the slope. Drag the bullet point to identify the new optimal amount of risk. Find the amount of insurance, $s$, that Juliana buys. (Write the condition that needs to hold at that point and explain.)
4. Why Juliana would not prefer any point on the dashed part of the insurance line?
5. Assume now that the slope of the insurance line is equal to 3. Is the insurance now cheaper or more expensive? Calculate the new amount of insurance, $s'$, that Juliana buys. Change the slope on the graph and verify.
6. What will happen if Juliana can choose insurance and risk level at the same time? Calculate the new $\Delta, \hat{y}(\Delta)$ and $s$. Move the insurance line on the graph to reflect that point. 
7. Discuss the differences between the two cases and explain.
