goals: [III.B.3]

The following figure includes two graphs. The left graph shows the BRF of firm i, its profit function, and the output produced by all other firms in the market. 
The right graph shows the marginal cost and the markup in the market. 
Let's assume now the following values:
      $$\bar{p}=20, c=2, \beta=0.5$$
      
1. Assume also that there are 8 firms in the market (n=8). Calculate the values for: $$x^i, X^{-i}, x^N(n), X^N(n), p^N(n), \pi^N(n), \Pi^N(n), \mu(n)$$ Remember that you can use the formulas we have already calculated in question 1.
2. Use the figure below to verify your answers by choosing the relevant values in the sliders.
3. Assume now that the number of firms in the market becomes 35 (n=35). Can you think how the variables of part 1 above will change? (mentimeter)
4. Use the graph to confirm your thinkg and explain the intuition.
