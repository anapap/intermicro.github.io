version: 0.2.6
goals: [III.B.3]

Let's assume now specific values for the following parameters:
      $$\bar{p}=20, c=2, \beta=0.5$$
      
1. Assume also that there are 8 firms in the market (n=8). Calculate the values for: $$x^N(n), X^N(n), p^N(n), \pi^N(n), \Pi^N(n), \mu(n)$$ Remember that you can use the formulas we have already calculated in question 1.
2. Use the figure below to verify your answers by choosing the relevant values in the sliders.
3. Assume now that the number of firms in the market becomes 35 (n=35). Can you think how the values of the variables you found in part a. above will change?
4. Use the figure below to confirm your thinking and explain the intuition.
