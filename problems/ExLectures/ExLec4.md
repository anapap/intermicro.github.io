The following figure shows .. Consider the credit market model, where a person (the borrower) wants to run a project but they need to borrow some of the required funds from a lender. Assume that $q$ denotes the quality of the project, $f$ is the probability with which the project fails, $\rho$ is the opportunity cost of capital, $\delta$ is the interest factor, and $k$ the amount that the borrower invests in the project (their equity). Recall that $f$ shows also the level of risk of the project.
      
1. Write the expected income function of the borrower and calculate the borrower's best-response function.
2. Which variables and parameters affect the BRF? Check on the graph what happens when you increase $\delta$ (ceteris paribus). Do the same with $q$ and $k$. Show it also mathematically and explain the intuition. 
3. Write the expected profit function and find the equilibrium $\delta$.
4. Find the Nash equilibrium. Assume $q=k=\frac{1}{2}$ and calculate the Nash equilibrium. Verify the numbers using the graph. 
5. Change the value of $q$ to .. and see how the equilibrium point chnages. Explain the intuition. Do the same with $k$.
