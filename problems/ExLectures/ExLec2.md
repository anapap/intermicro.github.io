The following figure includes two graphs...

1. Create the timeline of the game.
2. See the graph. What does an iso-value curve show? Calculate the slope and explain.
3. Find (formally) the agent's BRF. Assume that $\bar{u}=5$ and check the box on the graph to see the BRF. Verify that for different values of $p$, $q(p)$ corresponds to the values on the grpah.
4. What is the objective of the principal?
5. Find (formally) the Nash equilibrium. Assume again that $\bar{u}=5$. What is the equilibrium price? Choose that price on the graph. Verify that the equilibrium quantity is the one you have found. Explain.
6. Is the Nash equilibrium point Pareto efficient? Use the graph and explain.
